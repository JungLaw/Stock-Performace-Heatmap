# Stock Performance Heatmap Dashboard - Project Planning

## Executive Summary

This project aims to build an interactive financial heatmap dashboard that visualizes stock and ETF performance metrics using color-coded treemaps. The tool will enable users to compare securities across different timeframes and metrics (price changes and relative volume), providing institutional-quality analysis capabilities in an intuitive visual format.

## High-Level Direction & Vision

### Core Value Proposition
- **Visual Performance Analysis**: Transform complex numerical data into instantly interpretable visual patterns
- **Comparative Intelligence**: Enable side-by-side comparison of multiple securities with configurable groupings
- **Real-time Insights**: Provide current market data with historical context for informed decision-making
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple metrics, timeframes, and asset groupings for diverse analytical needs

### Target Use Cases
1. **Portfolio Performance Review**: Quick assessment of holdings vs market segments
2. **Sector Rotation Analysis**: Identify hot/cold sectors and country allocations
3. **Volume Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual trading activity that may signal opportunities
4. **Risk Assessment**: Visual identification of concentration risks and correlations

## Project Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope (MVP)
- Interactive heatmap visualization with Plotly treemaps
- Price performance analysis (1D to 12M periods)
- Relative volume analysis (vs 10D/3M averages)
- Three predefined asset groups: Country ETFs, Sector ETFs, Custom tickers
- Real-time data integration via yfinance
- Responsive web interface with Streamlit
- Intraday volume adjustment calculations
- Basic data persistence for API call optimization

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Real-time streaming updates
- Advanced technical indicators beyond price/volume
- Portfolio integration and position tracking
- Alert systems and notifications
- Custom themes and white-labeling
- Mobile native applications
- Advanced authentication/user management

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: All predefined asset groups render correctly
- **Performance**: Dashboard loads in <3 seconds for 50+ securities
- **Accuracy**: Price/volume calculations match reference sources
- **Usability**: Users can navigate between views without documentation

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Frontend Framework
**Streamlit** - Selected for rapid prototyping and built-in interactivity
- **Pros**: Fast development, native Python integration, good component ecosystem
- **Cons**: Limited customization, potential performance constraints at scale
- **Alternative considered**: Dash (more flexible but steeper learning curve)

### Visualization Library
**Plotly** - Primary choice for interactive charts
- **Treemap**: Main visualization for performance heatmaps
- **Heatmap**: Alternative layout for different data structures
- **Built-in interactivity**: Hover tooltips, zoom, click events

### Data Layer
**Primary Source**: yfinance API
- Real-time and historical price data
- Volume metrics and averages
- Company/ETF metadata

**Data Storage**: SQLite + CSV hybrid approach
- SQLite for structured queries and relationships
- CSV for bulk data exports and backups
- Local storage initially, cloud migration path planned

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits (yfinance)**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, batch requests, fallback data sources
   
2. **Data Quality Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Data validation, error handling, manual override capabilities
   
3. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - *Mitigation*: Lazy loading, data sampling, progressive rendering

### Business Risks
1. **Changing Requirements**
   - *Mitigation*: Modular architecture, clear interfaces, regular stakeholder reviews
   
2. **User Adoption**
   - *Mitigation*: User testing, documentation, training materials

### Data Risks
1. **Market Data Accuracy**
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple data source validation, clear disclaimers
   
2. **Real-time vs Delayed Data**
   - *Mitigation*: Clear timestamp displays, data freshness indicators

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Primary Developer**: Full-stack development, data analysis
- **Optional**: UI/UX consultant for design refinements
- **Testing**: End-user validation (financial analysts)

### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Local environment with Python 3.9+
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud or similar hosting platform
- **Data**: Internet connection for API access
- **Storage**: Minimal local storage requirements (<1GB)
