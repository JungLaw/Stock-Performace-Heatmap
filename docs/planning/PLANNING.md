# Stock Performance Heatmap Dashboard - Project Planning

## Executive Summary

This project aims to build an interactive financial heatmap dashboard that visualizes stock and ETF performance metrics using color-coded treemaps. The tool will enable users to compare securities across different timeframes and metrics (price changes and relative volume), providing institutional-quality analysis capabilities in an intuitive visual format.

### ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS: CORE MVP COMPLETE
**Major Milestone Achieved**: Basic functional heatmap dashboard with Finviz-style visualization

#### âœ… Completed Core Features:
- **Infrastructure**: Complete modular project structure with src/ organization
- **Performance Calculations**: Full implementation of price change calculations across all time periods (1D to 1Y, YTD)
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Professional Finviz-style treemap with exact color matching and rich tooltips
- **Interactive UI**: Complete Streamlit dashboard with sidebar controls, progress tracking, and data tables
- **Asset Groups**: Pre-configured Country ETFs (52), Sector ETFs (30), and Custom ticker support
- **Data Integration**: Real-time yfinance integration with error handling and caching

#### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing:
The dashboard now provides a fully functional MVP that can:
- Display performance heatmaps for any asset group
- Show price changes across multiple time periods
- Provide rich interactive tooltips and summary statistics
- Handle real-time data fetching with progress indicators
- Export and display detailed data tables

## High-Level Direction & Vision

### Core Value Proposition
- **Visual Performance Analysis**: Transform complex numerical data into instantly interpretable visual patterns

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: All predefined asset groups render correctly
- **Performance**: Dashboard loads in <3 seconds for 50+ securities
- **Accuracy**: Price/volume calculations match reference sources
- **Usability**: Users can navigate between views without documentation

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Frontend Framework
**Streamlit** - Selected for rapid prototyping and built-in interactivity
- **Pros**: Fast development, native Python integration, good component ecosystem
- **Cons**: Limited customization, potential performance constraints at scale
- **Alternative considered**: Dash (more flexible but steeper learning curve)

### Visualization Library
**Plotly** - Primary choice for interactive charts
- **Treemap**: Main visualization for performance heatmaps
- **Heatmap**: Alternative layout for different data structures
- **Built-in interactivity**: Hover tooltips, zoom, click events

### Data Layer
**Primary Source**: yfinance API
- Real-time and historical price data
- Volume metrics and averages
- Company/ETF metadata

**Data Storage**: SQLite + CSV hybrid approach
- SQLite for structured queries and relationships
- CSV for bulk data exports and backups
- Local storage initially, cloud migration path planned

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits (yfinance)**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, batch requests, fallback data sources
   
2. **Data Quality Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Data validation, error handling, manual override capabilities
   
3. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - *Mitigation*: Lazy loading, data sampling, progressive rendering

### Business Risks
1. **Changing Requirements**
   - *Mitigation*: Modular architecture, clear interfaces, regular stakeholder reviews
   
2. **User Adoption**
   - *Mitigation*: User testing, documentation, training materials

### Data Risks
1. **Market Data Accuracy**
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple data source validation, clear disclaimers
   
2. **Real-time vs Delayed Data**
   - *Mitigation*: Clear timestamp displays, data freshness indicators
