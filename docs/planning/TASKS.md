- [ ] Visual count indicators ("3 of 52 selected")

**Level 2 - Permanent List Expansion** (🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY):
- [ ] "Add new ticker to Country ETFs" input + validation + save button
- [ ] "Add new ticker to Sector ETFs" input + validation + save button
- [ ] Auto-select newly added tickers for immediate analysis
- [ ] Persistence across sessions (save to `assets.py` or session state)
- [ ] Ticker symbol validation before adding to permanent lists

**Level 3 - Session Custom Tickers** (🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY):
- [ ] Tag-style removable ticker interface (chip/pill UI)
- [ ] Individual add/remove with instant visual feedback

### 🔄 TASK B: Volume Analysis Implementation (READY FOR NEXT PHASE)
**Current State**: Infrastructure complete in `src/calculations/volume.py`
**Priority**: Medium (post-ticker management UI)
**Files**: `src/calculations/volume.py`, `streamlit_app.py`
**Goal**: Implement volume analysis with intraday adjustments per PRD

**Implementation Ready**:
- [ ] Complete volume calculation methods in `volume.py`
- [ ] Integrate intraday adjustment table (already defined)
- [ ] Add volume metric selection to UI
- [ ] Test with real-time volume data
- [ ] Validate against PRD requirements
